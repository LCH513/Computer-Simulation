 2-node tandem queue with two exponential servers and a single input of a Poisson process to the first node with difference three cases:

  1. an infinite-size buffer for the first node and a buffer with size 7 for the second node.
  2. a buffer with size 5 for the first node and an infinite-size buffer for the second node.
  3. two infinite-size buffers.
